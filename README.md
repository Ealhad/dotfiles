# My config files

I am currently using: 
 - **i3** as a window manager, with a dark-red theme.
 - **termite** as a terminal emulator
 - **emacs** (spacemacs) as my main text editor

If some of my keybindings don't seem to make any sense, it's because I am using
the [Colemak](https://colemak.com/) layout.
